# By default, the tool now parses the log to pull only the last sector's time for each plot.  This
# appears to be more accurate overall than the metrics method of taking an average of many hundreds

# Using only last sector time will certainly make the impact of any changes made apparent much more quickly.
# Set to False if you want to go back to the previous method of very long term averaging provided
# by the metrics.
